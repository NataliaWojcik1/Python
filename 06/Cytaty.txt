Life is ten percent what happens to you and ninety percent how you respond to it
All that we see and seem is but a dream within a dream
The purpose of our lives is to be happy
Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you’re going to get
Life itself is the most wonderful fairy tale
In order to write about life first you must live it.
Love For All, Hatred For None
Change the world by being yourself
Every moment is a fresh beginning.
Never regret anything that made you smile
Die with memories, not dreams
Aspire to inspire before we expire
Whatever you do, do it well.
